# How to clean

## What a proper table looks like
1. Example of a proper table: [proper table](https://github.com/yasserius/bd_district_statistics_dataset/blob/main/cleaned_CSVs/B_Baria/CHAPTER%2010_Medical%20institution%20and%20personnel%20by%20municipality%202011.csv)
2. The first row should be the table name.
3. The second row is optional, sometimes this will be empty, other time this will have a sentence.
4. Then third row will contain the column titles. If you see that the fourth row and fifth row also contain column titles,
then merge those cells with the other column titles so that they are in the same cell and there is only one column title row.
5. The rest of the rows are data tables. Usually the first column contains the upazila names. And the other columns contain numerical or word data.

## Types of errors

1. Random characters and string in the cells, e.g. "Bagerhat\t123" or "Ban gla d esh"
2. The column titles are **not** in a single row, they are in two or three rows. Merge the cells to make them into a single row.
3. Table title is missing in the first row.
4. Spelling mistakes in the names.
5. ???
